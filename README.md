# Overview

This software was created to expose myself to the basics of crafting a top-down 2D game within the Unity Game Engine to better assist in a team project that is doing a similar project.

My software that I created is a rudimentary 2D maze that the user must navigate a character through. This project utilizes a C# coding script to allow for the arrow keys to move the character around. In addition, there is collision applied over a tilemap of maze items. The character also has collision to prevent it from phasing through walls.

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration.  It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the software running and a walkthrough of the code.}

# Development Environment

The tools that I utilized in this project include Visual Studio 2022 and Unity Editor. I didn't use any libraries inside Visual Studio, I used the helpful websites and tutorials to know what to write.
